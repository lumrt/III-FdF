# FdF - 3D Landscape Representation

## Description

**FdF** (Fil de Fer) is a project that involves representing landscapes in 3D using an isometric projection of a Wireframe Model. This type of representation is widely used in fields such as modern mapping, space exploration, and the study of natural phenomena like tectonic activity.

The goal is to model beautiful landscapes, whether real or imaginary, and allow the user to interact with these models through simple keyboard controls.

## Features

- **Isometric Projection**: 3D view of a landscape.
- **User Interaction**:
  - Use **arrow keys** to move the model.
  - Use **Page Up** and **Page Down** to adjust the height of the peaks.
  - Use **+** and **-** to zoom in and out.

## Controls

| Key                    | Action                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Arrow keys             | Move the model                     |
| Page Up / Page Down     | Increase / Decrease peak height    |
| + / -                  | Zoom in / Zoom out                 |

## Objective

This project will allow you to:
- Visualize 3D landscapes to better understand geographical phenomena such as tectonic activity.
- Explore imaginary or real landscape models with an isometric view.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FdF.git

2. Make and execute the file:
  ```bash
  make ; ./fdf [mapfile]
